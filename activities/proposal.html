        <h3>Title and Topic</h3>
        <p>The title of my website will be “Discover India.” The topic of this site is to introduce the beauty, culture, tourism, food, and festivals of India. The website will explore what makes India a diverse and fascinating country, including history, famous places, traditional celebrations, and cultural lifestyles.</p>
        <h3>why I choose this topic</h3>
        <P>TO be frank, I am missing it a lot and also,I chose this topic because India is a country with a rich heritage, unique traditions, and beautiful diversity. People around the world hear about India, but many do not truly understand how many different cultures, foods, languages, and celebrations exist within one nation. By creating this website, I want to share the beauty of India in a respectful and educational way.</P>
        <h3>Content on Each Page</h3>
        <P>The homepage will introduce India and give a short overview of what the website is about.
Page 1 will focus on Indian culture, including languages, traditional clothing, and values.
Page 2 will highlight food from different regions of India, including a table comparing popular dishes and the states they come from.
Page 3 will cover Indian festivals such as Diwali, Holi, Eid, Christmas, Onam, and Baisakhi.
Page 4 will focus on tourism, including famous landmarks, natural locations, and travel destinations.
Page 5 will include a form where users can share what they would most like to experience in India, such as food, festivals, or travel destinations.</P>
<h3>Form and Table Information</h3>
<P>The form will collect user information such as name, age, country, favorite Indian food, festival, location they want to visit, and how they learned about India. I will also include fields asking whether they have visited India before and what interests them the most.
The table on the Food page will compare famous dishes from different states. For example, it may include dishes like Biryani, Masala Dosa, Butter Chicken, Misal Pav, and Rasgulla with columns showing region, spice level, and type</P>
<h3>How I Will Collect Content and References</h3>
<P>I will collect information for my website by researching reliable online sources, educational articles, and verified history or travel websites. I will also use images that are either copyright-free or licensed for public educational use. Two sources I plan to use Times of india and the Government of India official tourism website. More sources will be added during the project.</P>
<h3>Warning Acknowledgment</h3>
<p>I have read and understand the warnings. I will not copy or paste text from any website except small quotes with proper citation. All writing, HTML, and CSS will be my own work. I will not copy another student’s work or use copyrighted images without a proper license. I also confirm that I will not use ChatGPT or another AI system to generate the code or content on the final project pages.</p>
