  <p>I am really interested in anime, especially Demon Slayer. The story is full of action, emotion, and beautiful animation that makes every episode stand out. I enjoy following Tanjiroâ€™s journey as he trains to become stronger while protecting his sister Nezuko, who was turned into a demon. The mix of sword fights, breathing techniques, and powerful demons makes the show exciting to watch, and the friendships Tanjiro builds along the way add even more depth to the story.</p>
  <p>I like Demon Slayer because it teaches about courage, family, and perseverance even in the face of overwhelming challenges. The characters all have unique backstories that make them relatable and inspiring, showing that strength can come from both pain and hope. Every episode keeps me hooked, and the animation style makes the battles feel alive and intense. The way the anime combines heartfelt emotion with breathtaking fight scenes is what makes it one of my favorite shows.</p>

  <h3>About links</h3>
  <p><strong>relative link</strong></p>
  <p>A relative link is a link that connects to another page inside my own website. For example, I can make a link to my first assignment, the link by writing it as <a href="link.html">link page</a> A relative link only needs the file name because the page is saved in the same folder as this one.</p>
  <p><strong>Absolute link</strong></p>
  <p>An absolute link is a link that goes to a page on the internet and uses the full web address. For example, here is an absolute link to the official Demon Slayer website:
<a href="https://demonslayer-anime.com/">Demon Slayer Official Site</a>.</p>
