               <p>she is my other best friend at home  my sibling, my older sister, Prasanna. We always fight a lot, but no matter what, she’s the one who supports me even in my worst moments. She makes our house lively with her funny jokes and crazy energy. Even though we argue sometimes, I can’t imagine my life without her.</p>

                <p>The small little pumpkin he’s my nephew. I miss him a lot; he’s just 2 years old. This is my favourite picture because it was the first time he called me by my name. He’s also the one who took this selfie all by himself  we didn’t even know until I found it in the gallery!</p>
