    <p>What is normal flow in HTML?</p>
    <p>In HTML, normal flow means the natural way a web page arranges elements before you add any special CSS positioning. By default, block elements (like div p. h1) stack on top of each other from top to bottom, each starting on a new line. Inline elements (like span a strong) stay in the same line and only take up as much space as their content. This basic, natural arrangement of elements is called the normal flow of a web page</p>
    <div class="stop"></div>
    <p>What does float do? Why do you need to clear the float?</p>
    <figure class="campus floater">
        <img src="my.jpg" alt="byuh campsu"><figcaption>byu hawaii</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>float will help the image to be on left or right, and also to float the image to which ever direction we want.</p>
   <p>What do absolute, fixed, and relative do?</p> 
   <p>Absolute: Positions an element relative to its nearest positioned ancestor.

Fixed: Stays in the same place on the screen even when scrolling.

Relative: Moves an element relative to its normal position.</p>
<p>How can you make nice navigation buttons for mobile devices?</p>
<p>nav (navigation) element in HTML is used to define a section of links that help users move around a website, like menus or navigation bar</p>
