        <p1>Explain the difference between inline, embedded, and external CSS.</p1>

        <p>Inline CSS means you write the style inside the tag itself.
             Embedded CSS means you write the style inside the HTML file but in the <STYLE></STYLE>section. 
            External CSS means you write the style in a separate file and connect it to your HTM</p>
            <P1>Explain why you should only use external CSS.</P1>
            <P>We should use external CSS because it makes the website neat, easy to update, and you can use the same style for many pages.</P>
            <P1>What is a selector used for?</P1>
            <P>A selector is like a pointer that tells CSS which part of the webpage (like headings, paragraphs, or buttons) should get the style.</P1
