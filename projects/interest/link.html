        <h2>answers to the question</h2>
        <p>What is the root? What is the relationship between folder and file names and the path?</p>
        <p>the root of webiste is the file name and place where we wrote the code, example in activities if i file something link.html thats the root of webiste in the link. folder and file were described in the link.  </p>
        <p>What is a default document?</p>
        <p>default document is index.html if you remove the root in the link still this default file works</p>
        <p>Explain the difference between an absolute link and a relative link. Why would you use relative links?</p>
        <p>The absolute link is the link of outside page like other webpage, relative link is something our own web page, or own file. </p>
        <p>Link to another engagement assignment (something in the activity folder).</p>
        <p>just enter a:link and enter the folder or file name in the qutotation, and thats how you link  ex; <a href="first.html">here</a></p>
        <p>Link the last project</p>
        <p>just move your file from project to activities and do relative one </p>
        <p>Do links always need to be inside a NAV tag?
 </p>
 <p>no, just the one</p>
