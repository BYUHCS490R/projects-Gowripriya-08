        <h2> MY MISSION EXPERIENCE </h2>
    <hr>
    <h4><strong>HELLO, THIS IS G&Oacute;&Wcirc;&Racute;&Iacute;</strong></h4>
    <P>I served my mission as <strong>&Sacute;ister mogali</strong>,i served in <EM>india banglore mission</EM> which comes under the south part of india. it was a great experience for those 18 months from &agrave;pril2022-november 2023.In this two years i been to several palces in india like chennai, banglore, hyderbad and few other, i also learned two different langugaes which are tamil and kannada.  </P>
    <p><CAption>I</CAption>t was a great expereince to serve the lord and meet different people in this world. I gained lot of expereince during my mission both physically and spirtually, spirtually my testimony on heavenly father and jesuschrist has improved, it helped me build a habit of daily scriptures study and daily prayer, it also helped me to build a habit of sharing my testimony without any fear. And coming to the physical things, its my first time leaving being away from home, at first it was little weird and i was emotional weak but later on,i became more independent and to be emotionally strong.</p>

    <p><strong>some attrtibes that i build during my mission:</strong></h2>
    <ol type="A">
        <li>being kind</li>
        <li>independent</li>
        <li>fearless</li>
        <li>loving others with pure intention</li>
    </U></ol>
<p>one of my favourite quote which inspired me to stay strong in mission is :</p>
    

    <blockquote>" like the wise man we give gifts of <em>love + peace</em> as a disciple of jesuschrist"</blockquote>
