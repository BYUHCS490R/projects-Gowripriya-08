         <p>Demons slayer is my most favourite anime among all the anime i watched and thats my first anime</p>
         <p>I simply adore Demon Slayer, especially the character of Tanjiro Kamado. His never-give-up spirit, empathetic nature, and justice sense transform him into such an admirable hero. I appreciate how he balances his toughness and sensitivity, always trying to do his best in protecting his sister Nezuko and humanity in general even when confronted with overwhelming danger. The animation, action choreography, and emotional drama make every episode and movie a memorable one. Tanjiro's evolution from a timid, empathetic child to a skilled demon slayer proves the power of determination and empathy, which is why I connect with him so deeply.</p>

         <p>The most recent Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba – Swordsmith Village Arc and Infinity Castle story have taken the series to an even higher level. Infinity Castle is action-packed and thrilling, with battles that push the characters to their limits and also teach them valuable lessons like teamwork, courage, and persistence. I love how the story is not just action-heavy but also teaches life lessons—like never to quit, being yourself, and learning from your hardships. Witnessing Tanjiro and his friends face challenges and grow stronger together makes me want to stay motivated and feel hopeful that regardless of what is occurring, determination and sympathy can actually bring about change for the better.</p>
